    1 - Python Code: Progressin Data to obtain Main matrices                                              <br />
    2 - Matlab code: Using data and CPLEX functions to otbain result                                      <br />
CPLEX functions can be downloaded from IBM site with acedemic version using student mail and information. <br />
